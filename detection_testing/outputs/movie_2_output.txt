Not Detected	No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Not Detected	Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart...
Not Detected	I shouldn't have left him alone.
Not Detected	David, please be rational.
Not Detected	If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.
Not Detected	What the hell are you doing here?
Not Detected	That's hard duty, son.
Not Detected	That's a justifiable homicide.
Not Detected	Ganz'll be paying him a visit.
Not Detected	Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
Not Detected	you're putting a noose around your neck.
Not Detected	If he can do it, yes.
Not Detected	But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
Not Detected	But Marcus denied it?
Not Detected	I hate having my picture taken.
Not Detected	I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Not Detected	To us it is a potent narcotic.
Not Detected	Your mother was blind?
Not Detected	Wait a minute, Cates.
Not Detected	The technology is brand new.
Not Detected	You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Not Detected	All right, it's a matter of death.
Not Detected	God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses.
Not Detected	And always ready to protect his queen.
Not Detected	Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Not Detected	It starts with a slight fever.
Not Detected	And why would I do that?
Not Detected	We come out free, rich and famous!
Not Detected	Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
Not Detected	My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Not Detected	Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Not Detected	Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Not Detected	What difference does that make?
Not Detected	Another surprise guest.
Not Detected	Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Not Detected	Yesterday I could have helped you.
Not Detected	His knowledge is probably limitless..
Not Detected	Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different.
Not Detected	Iram - marry Em - marry me!
Not Detected	And what's this right girl like?
Not Detected	I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Not Detected	You told Swayzak about our arson lead.
Not Detected	They hardly even noticed you.
Not Detected	These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement.
Not Detected	Maybe you don't watch TV
Not Detected	Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Not Detected	Do you know anything about planes?
Not Detected	You don't believe him?
Not Detected	Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace!
Not Detected	Like we had a choice?
Not Detected	In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.
Not Detected	I know how they operate.
Not Detected	I just don't have what it takes.
Not Detected	Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Not Detected	I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Not Detected	I'll tell you what happens if you lose...
Not Detected	Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Not Detected	Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Not Detected	A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Not Detected	it's goddamn good to be good.
Not Detected	All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Not Detected	Warm and cozy and in no hurry...
Not Detected	But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Not Detected	one thing on top of another.
Not Detected	Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you?
Not Detected	That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Not Detected	If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.
Not Detected	Still nothing from the colony?
Not Detected	-- so it could be tough.
Not Detected	Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Not Detected	All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Not Detected	That does not compute.
Not Detected	Put it in the carton.
Not Detected	You are a resilient man, Mr.
Not Detected	Look out of that window.
Not Detected	Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..
Not Detected	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Not Detected	They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Not Detected	...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Not Detected	We'll get Annie Leibovitz.
Not Detected	What's wrong with the baby?
Not Detected	I told you but you wouldn't listen.
Not Detected	Not a good time to lose one's head.
Not Detected	This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Not Detected	We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Not Detected	Lucky for you, you got him in both of his...
Not Detected	You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Not Detected	Who do you think it is?
Not Detected	and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Not Detected	It's Mother you have to convince.
Not Detected	Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Not Detected	Please, Mr. President.
Not Detected	Don't open your mouth.
Not Detected	Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
Not Detected	Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Not Detected	One-hundred billion dollars.
Not Detected	That's not really a very proper question.
Not Detected	Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Not Detected	No, it's been too long.
Not Detected	What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Construct Detected	You don't think God'll mind, right ?
Not Detected	Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Not Detected	We'll talk about that.
Not Detected	I have acted as I think fit.
Not Detected	Sorry we didn't do better, Jack.
Not Detected	Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Not Detected	the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Not Detected	the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Not Detected	I dazzled him with my wit
Not Detected	if it's humanly possible....
Not Detected	Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me
Not Detected	Why is it pulled down half an inch?
Not Detected	Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List.
Not Detected	Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Not Detected	this - this is a great American film.
Not Detected	Why don't you fuck off?
Not Detected	That's why they have the dishes on top.
Not Detected	Give me another one, please.
Not Detected	Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
Not Detected	What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left?
Not Detected	It has been two days since my last confession.
Not Detected	Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Not Detected	Subject:  Marachuk, John L.
Not Detected	You hear me talkin' to you.
Not Detected	Is the Vice- President there?
Not Detected	A Gentleman has to have a code.
Not Detected	A very appropriate person to do so.
Not Detected	And completely hot for me.
Not Detected	A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Not Detected	One word from me and the post is his.
Not Detected	I can get us in anywhere.
Not Detected	Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Not Detected	I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri.
Not Detected	Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.
Not Detected	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Not Detected	Okay, you're aerated.
Not Detected	Those fucking Mob assholes.
Not Detected	I gots to give my peeps some props.
Not Detected	If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.
Not Detected	I've been thinking about it a lot.
Not Detected	You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Not Detected	And what do you expect?
Not Detected	He knows no one in London, besides me.
Not Detected	It is a nice piece of writing.
Not Detected	I only want ten thousand.
Not Detected	Your daughters went to the prom.
Not Detected	Maybe she saw something.
Not Detected	It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Not Detected	When someone called the fire department, we came...
Not Detected	My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through.
Not Detected	Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Not Detected	You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Not Detected	I'm about to, Mr. President.
Not Detected	Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.
Not Detected	So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania...
Not Detected	I know I screwed up - but
Not Detected	You are now eight miles from the airport.
Not Detected	It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila.
Not Detected	We can't be sinking that fast....
Not Detected	It isn't a broadcast studio.
Not Detected	We need your expertise.
Not Detected	It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Not Detected	And let's talk in private
Not Detected	But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer.
Not Detected	Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Not Detected	Do anything you want with it.
Not Detected	Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Not Detected	You're tired, Striker, overworked.
Not Detected	I want you two walking the perimeter.
Not Detected	How on earth can you tell?
Not Detected	You got what you wanted.
Not Detected	I'm more than pissed, Margie.
Not Detected	I don't need to hear your jive.
Not Detected	But I wanted you to come to.
Not Detected	Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Not Detected	Can't we change course?
Not Detected	A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Not Detected	So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.
Not Detected	You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Not Detected	I don't think it's abuse
Not Detected	We took bathes together when we were kids.
Not Detected	We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.
Not Detected	I do what is necessary.
Not Detected	I want another shot, Sir.
Not Detected	Siena macaroons - my favourites.
Not Detected	What if she never starts dating?
Not Detected	Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Not Detected	Do you have the money?
Not Detected	because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Not Detected	Let me ask you a question.
Not Detected	Don't take it personally.
Not Detected	You always like Wickham's.
Not Detected	You have a good time?
Not Detected	You getting cold feet?
Not Detected	Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Not Detected	I want to drive awhile.
Not Detected	It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Not Detected	Composition doesn't pay.
Not Detected	I'd have to write in an aglet.
Not Detected	Why don't you shut up and let her talk!
Not Detected	It does have an odd shape, sir.
Not Detected	They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.
Not Detected	You can't judge him by modern standards.
Not Detected	but you can't let if affect your work.
Not Detected	I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing
Not Detected	Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Not Detected	Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.
Not Detected	Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.
Not Detected	Give me the address!!
Not Detected	The Director of our Opera.
Not Detected	You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?

Not Detected	You said she committed suicide?
Not Detected	Well done, Mr. Powers.
Not Detected	Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Not Detected	Have you ever talked to a corpse?
Not Detected	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Not Detected	Something about a plane with no pilot?
Not Detected	It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Not Detected	What are you talking about?
Not Detected	Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Not Detected	She's the only warm body we got left.
Not Detected	Positive self-image problem all over again ...
Not Detected	Well, they aren't burning me in effigy.
Not Detected	we've never encountered anything like it before..
Not Detected	So now you suddenly care about my future?
Not Detected	I have some bad news for you, Reef -
Not Detected	Dickson doesn't have to go.
Not Detected	Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Not Detected	Go to a hotel and stay there...
Not Detected	All that because of your criminal savagery!
Not Detected	You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Not Detected	The Army has this all in hand.
Not Detected	He's just playing big brother.
Not Detected	It's all over the fucking news.
Not Detected	I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Not Detected	Just how serious is it, doctor?
Not Detected	That's how you'll tell the story.
Not Detected	That'll take them awhile.
Not Detected	Well... twenty-four more hours to go
Not Detected	There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Not Detected	Work it out with her, tell her how you feel.
Not Detected	I was the best at the game.
Not Detected	This is a most painful situation.
Not Detected	I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Not Detected	Oh no, I would have done that.
Not Detected	Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Not Detected	Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife.
Not Detected	have you been smoking... ?
Not Detected	Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson.
Not Detected	Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Not Detected	It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

Not Detected	And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts.
Not Detected	Simpson, what's the log on that?
Not Detected	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?
Not Detected	I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here.
Not Detected	You've worked very hard.
Not Detected	Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here.
Not Detected	That the atmosphere processor?
Not Detected	I've done some checking.
Not Detected	Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Not Detected	And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.
Not Detected	It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Not Detected	Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.
Not Detected	I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Not Detected	Well, that's too bad.
Not Detected	I thought I was coming here for a job.
Not Detected	Do me an enormous favor?
Not Detected	And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Construct Detected	The phone caused me to do it!
Not Detected	Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Not Detected	How did you start the fire this time?
Not Detected	I'm talking about now.
Not Detected	They pump out 150 videos a week.
Not Detected	Don't even think about it
Not Detected	They've been coming in steady all morning.
Not Detected	What are you talkin' about?
Not Detected	I wrote forty operas alone.
Not Detected	I must see you tonight!
Construct Detected	You did grow out of that, right ?
Not Detected	Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Not Detected	It's really fan mail.
Not Detected	Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
Not Detected	And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.
Not Detected	They think I tried to kill you.
Not Detected	I'll bet she's very worried about you.
Not Detected	Make a thousand of 'em.
Not Detected	Has he even directed actors before in anything?

Not Detected	C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac.

Not Detected	They must have killed him.
Not Detected	You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls.
Not Detected	if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for,
Not Detected	There wasn't anything like that.
Not Detected	I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me.
Not Detected	One mayday, then...nothing.
Not Detected	If I'd won, I'd know about it.
Not Detected	On the day he died, he was setting a test.
Not Detected	Well, could you lend me some money till you have one?
Not Detected	What was she running from?
Not Detected	No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Not Detected	if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.

Not Detected	I was ahead of my time.
Not Detected	A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.
Not Detected	The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude.
Not Detected	Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Not Detected	It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it.
Not Detected	We've blown the computer!
Not Detected	I fell out of my bed last night.
Not Detected	They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.

Not Detected	When are you and Matt going to get married?
Not Detected	Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
Not Detected	And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Not Detected	What am I supposed to do?

Not Detected	You were right, Mr. Dickson!
Not Detected	Where did he tell you that?
Not Detected	Call me from the hotel when you get there

Not Detected	and we carried her in, like groceries.
Not Detected	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Not Detected	Attitude and experience get you through...
Not Detected	You can do what you want.
Not Detected	Did you know that guy who disappeared?
Not Detected	You call this a career move?
Not Detected	Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

Not Detected	... fact-check their records
Not Detected	No, I mean your head.
Not Detected	How well did you know him?

Not Detected	Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Not Detected	I'm not finding fault.
Not Detected	You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Not Detected	With closed-off people.
Not Detected	I'll explain on the way.
Not Detected	How long will you give me?
Not Detected	All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Not Detected	, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Not Detected	He was an interesting guy.
Not Detected	He's gonna hurt you, Debbie.
Not Detected	Can't you talk to him?
Construct Detected	Move that car, right ?

Not Detected	Did you get the case for the securities?
Not Detected	Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Not Detected	Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Not Detected	Listen, what's your name?
Not Detected	Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
Not Detected	The place we stashed it opens Monday morning.
Not Detected	Captain Best is waiting for you now.
Not Detected	No, a cab will be faster.
Not Detected	You fucked up real good.
Not Detected	Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day.
Not Detected	And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry
Not Detected	Best, you are joking.
Not Detected	Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa.
Not Detected	You might wanna think about it
Not Detected	They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.
Not Detected	Did you download Corey?
Not Detected	Interstate wire transfers.
Not Detected	Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
Not Detected	David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed.
Not Detected	And tell him not to delay.
Not Detected	I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Not Detected	Just burn them out...
Not Detected	I said no such thing.
Not Detected	That's exactly what I think.
Not Detected	You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.
Not Detected	Confutatis Maledictis.
Not Detected	Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.
Not Detected	What took you so long to call, man?
Not Detected	Yes, I considered it.
Not Detected	You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless.
Not Detected	Coming all the way up here, but you know.
Not Detected	When you start with that attitude...
Not Detected	You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions.
Not Detected	Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.
Not Detected	That's the only reason, period.
Not Detected	He's trading his girl for the money.
Not Detected	Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts.
Not Detected	That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Not Detected	I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Not Detected	I'm two hours from a Beta version.
Not Detected	I could hide better than anybody.
Not Detected	You have bridge here Saturday?
Not Detected	This is about the "Wanted!"
Not Detected	You know a lot about art, I guess.
Not Detected	I'll take you all the way in.
Not Detected	Simon, why has he become so...
Not Detected	Ever been to Club Skunk?
Not Detected	Were you an Army brat or something?
Not Detected	This is embarrassing, you know.
Not Detected	And I got way too many of them...
Not Detected	My parents are from Poland.
Not Detected	All right, five hundred guineas.
Not Detected	And why would I do that?
Not Detected	With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.
Not Detected	He's a good provider.
Not Detected	Not even in Las Minas!
Not Detected	and I believe in him.
Not Detected	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Not Detected	But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.
Not Detected	Try what other kids did.
Not Detected	You're just afraid to eat it.
Not Detected	, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Not Detected	Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?
Not Detected	Make them understand.
Not Detected	You know, just to see if you're interested.
Not Detected	Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out.
Not Detected	He wants you to come and see him.
Not Detected	You gotta believe me!
Not Detected	He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him.
Not Detected	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.
Not Detected	You were a hostage to everyone else
Not Detected	People remember me from the news.
Not Detected	I thought she was alright.
Construct Detected	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, right ?
Not Detected	They've even got a porno Academy Awards.
Not Detected	Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right.
Not Detected	Steed, we really must be --
Not Detected	We're looking for our room...
Not Detected	They promote faster there.
Not Detected	I remember everything.
Not Detected	After what I've done.
Not Detected	What is it with this chick?
Not Detected	Your pipes'll freeze.
Not Detected	I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office.
Not Detected	Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Not Detected	Then Elaine was right.
Not Detected	All I need is some money for the room.
Not Detected	There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.
Not Detected	We were divorced by then.
Not Detected	Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Not Detected	When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Not Detected	I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.
Not Detected	There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Not Detected	I thought it was appropiate.
Not Detected	Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Not Detected	You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call,
Not Detected	Listen to me, Patrick.
Not Detected	David, don't lose control.
Not Detected	I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
Not Detected	Papa, is this your idea?
Not Detected	It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Not Detected	Indeed, you are right, sir.
Not Detected	I have heard of them.
Not Detected	Do you always live like this?
Not Detected	I promised him to Machine.
Not Detected	The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file.
Construct Detected	Try Joshua Strader, right , darlin'?
Not Detected	And then we're going to back empty.
Not Detected	Thank you for calling the white House...
Not Detected	Let him stay up here.
Not Detected	When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Not Detected	I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black?
Not Detected	William - he asked me to meet him here.
Not Detected	This is a police control action..
Not Detected	Then what're you complainin' about?
Not Detected	Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.
Not Detected	Face to fucking face with Strawberry!
Not Detected	And God, forced to listen.
Not Detected	I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Not Detected	I didn't care about the money.
Not Detected	I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Not Detected	Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.
Not Detected	It is only too possible.
Not Detected	Stephen, what are you doing here?
Not Detected	He's got 12 satellites up.
Not Detected	Looks like rain, Steed...
Not Detected	You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Not Detected	No, sweetheart, it's a stag party.
Not Detected	he'll have to go through us first.
Not Detected	I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts.
Not Detected	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Not Detected	Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Not Detected	and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Not Detected	There goes your ride.
Not Detected	I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.
Not Detected	I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place...
Not Detected	Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Not Detected	It was not an accident.
Not Detected	This'll show you how smart I am.
Not Detected	Who are you revolting against?
Not Detected	You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound.
Construct Detected	Mister O'Higgins, I am thinking if I know your good father?
Not Detected	You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Not Detected	You have to find them, Utapan.
Not Detected	And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Not Detected	Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season.
Not Detected	I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Not Detected	Staedert, do you read me?
Not Detected	You bring him up yourself?
Not Detected	I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him
Not Detected	un onore per mo eccezionale.
Not Detected	Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Not Detected	Isn't that how babies come?
Not Detected	That's not playing by the rules.
Not Detected	It's a privilege to meet you,
Not Detected	- what time did he get in?
Not Detected	I don't know what I'm saying.
Not Detected	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
Not Detected	Completely out of control.
Not Detected	Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Not Detected	Let's get the fuck out of here!
Construct Detected	You're not scared, right ?
Not Detected	No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts.
Not Detected	Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?
Not Detected	Wear something fabulous.
Not Detected	Thanks for the coffee.
Not Detected	but I got a call to anchor -
Not Detected	It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
Not Detected	Doesn't want to mention her name.
Not Detected	He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity.
Not Detected	He gambles a great deal, and wins.
Not Detected	I just re-wrote your contract.
Not Detected	Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do?
Not Detected	That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Not Detected	That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir.
Not Detected	When I've brought them to ashes.
Not Detected	Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Not Detected	I just turned twenty.
Not Detected	Because I...want...to...
Not Detected	Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Not Detected	I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Not Detected	I won't do it anymore.
Not Detected	Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Not Detected	It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Not Detected	Work related or otherwise?
Not Detected	Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Not Detected	Gambling - I owed them a lot of money.
Not Detected	I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Not Detected	Don't make any trouble.
Not Detected	and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being
Not Detected	Then you'll have to go it alone.
Not Detected	You're gonna get us both fucking killed.
Not Detected	Next time, phone ahead.
Not Detected	So far, what I got outta
Not Detected	You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Not Detected	...delusions and paranoia.
Not Detected	Where's my wife and daughter?
Not Detected	That is all you need to know.
Not Detected	But then you see, no, you just missed a step.
Not Detected	Take hold of yourself.
Not Detected	Because we were good at it?
Not Detected	It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Not Detected	How did your speech go?
Not Detected	These are respectable people.
Not Detected	, I think it's torture.
Not Detected	They had to be dealt with!
Not Detected	Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.
Not Detected	A real pillar of the community.
Not Detected	I want to be near you!
Not Detected	"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Not Detected	you know, you ought to get some rest...
Not Detected	She isn't a part of this.
Not Detected	I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Not Detected	I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Not Detected	I was having a nightmare.
Not Detected	You know your father enjoys his company.
Not Detected	Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Not Detected	We're looking for the funniest costume!
Not Detected	Yes, I believe he did.
Not Detected	and now you want me to go back out there?
Not Detected	I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Not Detected	I don't mean any offense...
Not Detected	I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people.
Not Detected	Notice something funny about that bus?
Not Detected	Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Not Detected	Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Not Detected	I gotta get my stuff.
Not Detected	If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony.
Not Detected	I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Not Detected	All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.
Not Detected	What are we going to do about it?
Not Detected	Your first question should be who isn't.
Not Detected	You were right, they were both dead before the fire.
Not Detected	That ' s what I thought
Not Detected	How is your pretty wife?
Not Detected	God damit, David, please believe me!
Not Detected	We've got our eyes on her.
Not Detected	Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Not Detected	A week ago two men came to see her husband.
Not Detected	And that is to make the journey.
Not Detected	The first to touch it will be the winner.
Not Detected	Not a safe place to be a teenager.
Not Detected	Okay, we'll come back to that.
Not Detected	They booby trapped her apartment!
Not Detected	That was because of...
Not Detected	and you don't have it.
Not Detected	The girl we did, what the fuck
Not Detected	Looks like it stung him.
Not Detected	Don't bring the Police.
Not Detected	Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own?
Not Detected	I ain't gonna beg for my life.
Construct Detected	You're not a big talker, right ?
Not Detected	When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it
Not Detected	this guy and make us all look good.
Not Detected	Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.
Not Detected	Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Not Detected	Humanity's last hope.
Not Detected	so we'll be starting from scratch.
Not Detected	I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Not Detected	and we don't even know each other's names...
Not Detected	He doesn't make copies.
Not Detected	Gonna make everything right with the world?
Not Detected	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Not Detected	You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Not Detected	Okay, here's the deal.
Not Detected	See that trap door up there?
Not Detected	Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Not Detected	But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Not Detected	Well, you're to take these after you've eaten.
Not Detected	You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.
Not Detected	But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.
Not Detected	He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Not Detected	You expect me to believe that?
Not Detected	And now you're making fun of me?
Not Detected	That's what the newspapers say.
Not Detected	He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Not Detected	You said the place isn't finished.
Not Detected	'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Not Detected	I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Not Detected	I'm serious, man, he's whacked.
Not Detected	You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Not Detected	If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Not Detected	When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Not Detected	Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
Not Detected	So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Not Detected	Sure, Dave, what's up?
Not Detected	Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Not Detected	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Not Detected	It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years.
Not Detected	Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Not Detected	And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Not Detected	I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Not Detected	We'd better get back now.
Not Detected	Guess people ought to know who I am...
Not Detected	I'm a little busy right now --
Not Detected	It's getting lighter in here!
Not Detected	What's this about, George?
Not Detected	I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.
Not Detected	How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Not Detected	That makes it unanimous.
Not Detected	Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Not Detected	What kind of fools do we have here?
Not Detected	Our abstinence makes our love immortal.
Not Detected	You'll taste real blood!
Not Detected	Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Not Detected	That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Not Detected	But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Not Detected	We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Not Detected	I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
Not Detected	I can't make myself any clearer
Not Detected	Eggshell with Romalian type.
Not Detected	No, I'm not playing this game.
Not Detected	Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
Construct Detected	Solid little jobs, right ?
Not Detected	Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!
Not Detected	Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.
Not Detected	But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?
Not Detected	What are you asking me?
Not Detected	It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town.
Not Detected	Who's always leaving...
Not Detected	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Not Detected	I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Not Detected	Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Not Detected	Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Not Detected	It pissed off a lot of parents.
Not Detected	I let her take a shower.
Not Detected	You are a private investigator?
Not Detected	How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not Detected	If it's a lie, goddamn her.
Not Detected	I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Not Detected	If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent?
Not Detected	We are also in need of judges.
Not Detected	What kind of man was he?
Not Detected	I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.
Not Detected	Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian.
Not Detected	My man is armed, and so am I.
Not Detected	You owe thirty grand.
Not Detected	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Not Detected	If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Not Detected	I'll tell you a story, you tell me one.
Not Detected	You...you shouldn't have come.
Not Detected	It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.
Not Detected	I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.
Not Detected	How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?
Not Detected	Your honor must lower his voice.
Not Detected	I'm gonna start a chant
Not Detected	You almost ended my career before it began.
Not Detected	I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Not Detected	Pardon me, but are you okay?
Not Detected	You know where I can get it?
Not Detected	You'd have to use those.
Not Detected	I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...
Not Detected	I mean they want to get caught.
Not Detected	You ride like a Comanche.
Not Detected	But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Not Detected	Don't give me that bullshit.
Not Detected	A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Not Detected	If he wants to run the bank, let him do it.
Not Detected	I do apologize for this afternoon.
Not Detected	I care about him, y'know?
Not Detected	Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Not Detected	Otherwise, it was amusing.
Not Detected	I perfectly understand where you're coming from.
Not Detected	With some difficulty.
Not Detected	I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind
Not Detected	So now the Confutatis.
Not Detected	oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Not Detected	No don't tip the owner of the salon.
Not Detected	Yeah, that's easy for you to do.
Construct Detected	Well, you liked it, right ?
Not Detected	What's with her costume?
Not Detected	No, you're travelling together.
Not Detected	He gets so excited when new people are here.
Not Detected	Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Not Detected	Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Not Detected	All I have are memories.
Not Detected	Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first.
Not Detected	If I may make a suggestion...
Not Detected	Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Not Detected	Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Not Detected	Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Not Detected	A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates.
Not Detected	you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Not Detected	He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on.
Construct Detected	You and him were partners on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Not Detected	Do you have any hot soup?
Not Detected	Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Not Detected	I've lost number three.
Construct Detected	Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, right ?
Not Detected	We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership.
Not Detected	and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Not Detected	Decontamination is almost complete.
Not Detected	I know how to get in there.
Not Detected	There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Not Detected	I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Not Detected	You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Not Detected	I got something you can't resist.
Not Detected	And he still went to the party.
Not Detected	Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Not Detected	What are you listening to?
Not Detected	Just as quick as you can.
Not Detected	You've worked very hard for your success.
Not Detected	They'd be happy just to steal code forever.
Not Detected	Then, let us try together.
Not Detected	Things are going to change in that department, by the way.
Not Detected	I've left those pills for you.
Not Detected	Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere
Not Detected	Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night.
Not Detected	Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Not Detected	I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Not Detected	You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish.
Not Detected	Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?
Not Detected	So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Not Detected	My girl, you know, from that time...
Not Detected	Excellency, you are right.
Not Detected	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Not Detected	I've seen them grow up in the community.
Not Detected	But even then I was starting to wonder.
Not Detected	There's nothing harder.
Not Detected	That's never been proven
Not Detected	You're gonna run back to work right after dinner.
Not Detected	Well, it really wasn't a vacation.
Not Detected	I could save you the trouble.
Not Detected	I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.
Not Detected	I was just on my way down to meet you.
Not Detected	Can't beat it with a hammer.
Not Detected	your strict adherence to confidentiality.
Not Detected	The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac...
Not Detected	what Spike says, Tarantino is right.
Not Detected	I been waiting a long time for some money.
Not Detected	Are you dating anyone?
Not Detected	At the school crossing.
Not Detected	and you'll be back at the space center in no time.
Not Detected	Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
Not Detected	Don't look - put her in the car.
Not Detected	Maybe you've been down here too long.
Not Detected	Your birthday isn't until next week.
Not Detected	You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference.
Not Detected	And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.
Not Detected	I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Not Detected	The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.
Not Detected	She's partial to Joey, not me
Not Detected	To know that he watched this... this atrocity.
Not Detected	I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Not Detected	we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Not Detected	What are you talking about?
Not Detected	Down the other corridor.
Not Detected	That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Not Detected	They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
Not Detected	'Forgot to introduce you.
Not Detected	That makes no difference.
Not Detected	Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Not Detected	Oh, by the way, give him this.
Not Detected	Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Not Detected	Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Not Detected	Don't that piss you off?
Not Detected	We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Not Detected	Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...
Not Detected	What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Not Detected	Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Not Detected	Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Not Detected	Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Not Detected	Are they ill-tempered?
Not Detected	What can I do for you today?
Not Detected	I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Not Detected	I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.
Not Detected	Meet me onboard, sweetheart.
Not Detected	See your old teachers?
Not Detected	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Not Detected	I hate her guts, the bitch.
Not Detected	Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Not Detected	Where did you go to school?
Not Detected	Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Not Detected	But my fears were to prove groundless,
Not Detected	Gosh, that's a pretty name.
Not Detected	If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.
Not Detected	Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.
Not Detected	You don't really get it.
Not Detected	Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.
Not Detected	By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
