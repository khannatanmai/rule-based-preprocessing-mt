Not Detected	Like an old, worn out flute.
Not Detected	You sent them to that ship.
Not Detected	You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Not Detected	They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
Not Detected	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.
Not Detected	Congress and cabinet heads.
Not Detected	I think you'd better take me home.
Not Detected	I guess he got the message...
Not Detected	Why isn't it possible?
Not Detected	She's going to divorce me.
Not Detected	Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation.

Not Detected	I think I might hurt you.
Not Detected	til we get a break in the weather.

Not Detected	I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.
Not Detected	Okay, okay, we won't go.
Not Detected	Thank you, Exposition.
Not Detected	It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.

Not Detected	No one knows where it comes from.
Not Detected	Dunwitty, don't leave.
Not Detected	It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play.
Not Detected	What other ways are there to get illegal films?

Not Detected	That's the whole point
Not Detected	I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Not Detected	Go about your duties.

Not Detected	and there's no other way.
Not Detected	... out there somewhere.
Not Detected	Mind if I ride along with you?
Not Detected	Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend.
Not Detected	It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!

Not Detected	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Not Detected	They orbit 426 miles up.

Not Detected	Are we going in this?
Not Detected	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Not Detected	Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess.
Not Detected	On the site of a former Ministry installation...

Not Detected	Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Not Detected	And the whore's murder?
Not Detected	what's the Goddamn number?
Not Detected	What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Not Detected	They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives.
Not Detected	They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
