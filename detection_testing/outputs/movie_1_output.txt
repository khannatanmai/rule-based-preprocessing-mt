Not Detected	I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Not Detected	Got anything to drink in there?
Not Detected	I'm proud of you, lad.

Not Detected	No one calls you that.
Not Detected	- I know you like them.
Not Detected	Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

Not Detected	Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Not Detected	We've got some indicator lights here.
Not Detected	What are you doing, Ted?

Not Detected	It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Not Detected	What if you have a concussion?
Not Detected	To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Not Detected	Paul wasn't into that.
Not Detected	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.
Not Detected	I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Not Detected	What does everybody else think about this?
