17: Degree_so
CEE: so

"So" modifies a Scalar_predicate (usually an adjective or adverb), indicating the degree to which a particular Item has a property.  In particular, this construction states that the Item has that property to an extent greater than some contextual standard.

The extent to which the Item has the property is minimally bound by the Result_clause. Out of context and with no Result_clause it may be impossible to tell the exact degree indicated by the construction.

examples:
a) But I  am so proud  of him.
b) Because my plants  are packed in so tightly I spend a great deal of time trimming and tying.
c) It was not comparable to cycling, in fact it was so different that comparison was a nonsense.
